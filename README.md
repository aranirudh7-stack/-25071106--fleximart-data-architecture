## Project Overview

The FlexiMart Data Architecture Project focuses on designing and implementing a complete data ecosystem for a retail business. The project includes building an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load transactional data into a relational database, performing NoSQL operations for product catalog management using MongoDB, and creating a star schema–based data warehouse for advanced analytics.

The project demonstrates integration of structured and semi-structured data, efficient query handling, and analytical reporting to support business decision-making.
